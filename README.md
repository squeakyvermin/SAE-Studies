Cody's SAE research &amp; study notes

## Why Github?
Fistly I take all of my notes in either Obsidian or Logseq, or more importantly in Markdown.
This is done for:
1. A localised format for my notes.
  - Where I'm not (completely) subject to the cloud  
2. Markdown notes are saved as Plain Text
  - If a platform for note taking suddenly becomes redundant, I still have complete access to everything I've written down
  - This also has the ability to easily (more or less) transfer to another app or platform that supports Markdown Syntax
